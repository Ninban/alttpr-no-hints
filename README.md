# ALTTPR no hints generation

Get the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/alttpr-no-hints/)! 

This was thrown together in a few minutes.  
With v31 release of ALTTPR in a month or two this extension will become useless and I will remove it.

As long as it works, I likely will not modify it either, but feel free to open issues and/or pull requests :)

Thanks to [Synack](https://github.com/tcprescott) for the JSON data that allows creation of a race seed without hints!
